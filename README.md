# UrgeButton

**UrgeButton** is an iOS app designed to help users track and resist their urges, whether it's checking social media, snacking, smoking, or other habits. With a single satisfying tap, users can log moments of discipline and visualize progress over time.

## Overview

UrgeButton makes self-control intuitive. With a large animated button, tactile feedback, and a minimal interface, users are rewarded for resisting urges rather than punished for failure. The experience is meant to be encouraging, low-friction, and completely private.

Users can create and manage multiple urges, view streaks and daily stats, and easily log relapses to reset progress. It's a lightweight habit tracker with a behavioral-first design.

## Why I Built This

As someone with ADHD and anxiety, I often struggle with managing urges and staying on track. I built UrgeButton to make that process a little easier, a simple, satisfying way to track moments of self-control without guilt or overcomplication. Itâ€™s a tool designed to give immediate feedback, reinforce progress, and support real habit-building through small wins.
